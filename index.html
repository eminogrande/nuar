        <p>Max Hackauf was born in 1982 and has been DJing with vinyl since he was 17 years old. His musical journey began at the age of 8 when he started playing the drums. Later, he discovered the radio show “Clubnight” and was captivated by its drum-heavy electronic sound. At 17, he bought his first mixer and began learning how to mix vinyl. In 2004, he started hosting his own parties in Frankfurt am Main. In 2009, he won a DJ contest at the Kunstkeller in Giessen and played in all the clubs in Frankfurt before traveling to Ibiza to perform. Max continuously bought records and now owns more than 10,000. In 2022, he decided to move to Zanzibar with his family to open the Why Not Club and play there as a resident DJ while also managing the club.
